        This is not a recipe book. This is not kitchen instruction. This is a guide to becoming an independent chef. I hope to offer a set of fundamentals and actionable steps to give you a deeper understanding of food. This should be read as a complete guide, but if you’re looking for the flavor cheatsheet, you’ll find it here.<br/><br/>
        Regardless of your skill level, I hope that by the end, you understand the fundamentals of dish composition, and gain the confidence that you can create your own dishes in the kitchen, independent from recipes.<br/><br/>

        The structure of the guide is as follows:
        <ol className="text__list">
          <li>Think about your palette, and how to taste food intentionally</li>
          <li>Understand the fundamentals of what makes a great dish</li>
          <li>Apply those fundamentals to create your own dishes</li>
          <li>Examples that put it all together</li>
        </ol>
        <br/>
        We hope these sections will show you the open-endedness and limitless possibilities within food.
        <br/><br/>

        Lastly, practice is key. As mentioned before, food is an art, and like any other art, you won’t get good at it just by reading this guide. The more you practice thinking and cooking this way, the more confident you will become in making your own dishes. Let’s get started:&nbsp;
        <div className="text__summary">
        In 30 seconds: eat my ass
        </div>
      </div>
    </>
  );

};
