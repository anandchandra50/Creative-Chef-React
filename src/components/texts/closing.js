      We hope we have armed you with the tools you need to become an independent chef, so go and try it, and have fun with it! The kitchen is your playground. Experiment with different flavors, textures, ingredients and cooking methods. Try playing with presentation: colors, plating, sauce, and aesthetic. Don’t be discouraged when a dish doesn’t come out perfect, rather, learn from it. We believe in you!<br/><br/>
